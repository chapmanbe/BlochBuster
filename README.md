ABOUT
-----
BlochBuster is a nuclear magnetic resonance Bloch equation simulator written in Python. It simulates magnetization vectors based on the Bloch equations, including precession, relaxation, and excitation. BlochBuster outputs animated GIF files, which are 3D plots of the magnetization vectors and/or plots of transverse and longitudinal magnetization.  Input paramaters are provided by human readable configuration files.

CONFIG FILES
------------
The configuration files are in json- or yaml-format. See example configuration files provided with BlochBuster for details.

The "pulseSeq" field is a list of RF pulses, each happening at time "t" [msec] with "FA" denoting the flip angle. Optionally, "phase" can be used to alter the phase of the RF pulse. "FA": 0 is interpreted as spoiling of transverse magnetization. The pulse sequence repeats after "TR" msec, with "nTR" repetitions. The main field "B0" is given in T, and the RF pulse duration is determined by "B1" in &mu;T. "B1"&ge;100; gives "instant" RF pulses; the clock will freeze and no relaxation or precession will occur.

The "components" field is a list of components/tissues, each represented by a magnetization vector with a distinct color in the plot. "Meq" is the vector length at equilibrium, "CS" is chemical shift in ppm, "T1" and "T2" are relaxation times in msec. Each component may be represented by a "fan" of "nIsochromats" vectors, with a distribution of precession frequencies determined by "isochromatStep" [ppm].

The animation speed is determined by the "speed" field, where 1 corresponds to real-time. The animated GIFs are saved in the /out folder. Specifying a filename for "outFile3D" will toggle a 3D animated plot of the magnetization vectors. "outFileMxy" and "outFileMz"  will toggle animated plots of transverse and longitudinal magnetization, respectively.

HOW TO USE
----------
`Example 1: python BlochBuster.py -c "config/SE.json"`

`Example 2: python BlochBuster.py -c "config/STIR.json" -l 5 -b`

The -c flag specifies which configuration file to use as input.  
The -l flag is optional and specifies a leap factor, allowing frames to be skipped when generating the video file. This enables fast preview for testing.  
The -b flag toggles black background.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
BlochBuster was written in Python 3.4.3, using libraries Matplotlib 1.4.3 and
Numpy 1.9.3. BlochBuster uses ImageMagick to create animated GIF files, so
ImageMagick should be installed (www.imagemagick.org).
